# Bill's Java Practice
The contents of this repo are small practice projects
in Java that I intend to share on my personal webpage.

As I learn more about Java, I am doing these projects to explore
what I learn in my own fashion.

While these examples compile and run for me, please do not
take this code as an answer to your homework.
1. That's straight up plagiarism.
2. I may do things in this code that drive your teacher crazy.
3. Programming it yourself is the only way the work is fun. Don't
  make programmming boring!
