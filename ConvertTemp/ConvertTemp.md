## ConvertTemp
The development of a Celsius to Fahrenheit converter is a great
task to embark on when working with a new programming language.

We were tasked with creating a simple conversion tool in class. The
expectation was that we hardcode a single conversion. Since Java
isn't my first programming language, I decided to try to trick out
this class so we can dynamically ask for conversion of either C to F
or F to C.

Since I haven't learned about error handling in Java, I implemented
a switch statement and did some helper functions that prevent bad
values from being evaluated.

I probably do some dumb things here, but I am pretty happy with how
it works. The class accepts two styles of input: one argument,like "32f"
or two arguments: "32 f".

If the input doesn't jive with the logic, it should spit out red text with
an example of valid input for the class. Basically, I tried to accomplish this
with only a couple days of class content. It's a naive solution that
I intend to revise when I know more about Java.
